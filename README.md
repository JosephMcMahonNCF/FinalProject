This project is modeled after the popular Spotify Wrapped trend, which offers Spotify users to look back at their listening stats for the previous year. 
While Spotify offers a good amount of graphs and insights, I would like more customization, so I created my own!

I will send you a folder containing my Spotify data which you can then load into the first file in the gitub repository folder named "organized".
Then you will be accompany me on a journey through my personal Spotify listening trends!


I used chatGPT to find some commands that worked, but the majority of the work is my own.
